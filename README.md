    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Passionate AWS Cloud Engineer with a proven track record of designing, implementing, and optimizing cloud-based solutions to drive operational efficiency and scalability. With a solid foundation in AWS services and a deep understanding of DevOps methodologies, I excel in architecting resilient, highly available, and cost-effective infrastructures for diverse business needs.

My expertise spans across the AWS ecosystem, including but not limited to EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM, CloudFormation, and more. I streamline deployment pipelines and accelerate software delivery while ensuring security and compliance standards are met. Also, I am a Data Engineer with expertise in designing scalable databases and data modeling to drive efficient data storage and analytics. I have a strong background in developing and enforcing data governance principles, ensuring data quality, security (RBAC, IAM), and compliance (GDPR) across both cloud and on-premise environments. Passionate about optimizing data pipelines, real-time processing, and cloud-based solutions, I thrive in building high-performance data architectures that empower businesses with actionable insights.

I thrive in dynamic environments, collaborating cross-functionally to align technical solutions with business objectives. Whether it's implementing infrastructure as code practices, or orchestrating containerized applications with Kubernetes, I am committed to driving innovation and continuous improvement.

I am dedicated to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies and best practices in cloud computing and automation. Let's connect to discuss how I can contribute to your team's success in navigating the complexities of the cloud landscape and achieving strategic goals.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AML Data migration and Hadoop/Datalake Platform</strong> – As a Senior Big Data Engineer for Apple’s business groups, I was responsible for designing and implementing a scalable    Data Warehousing solution that supported historical data loading, incremental data ingestion, batch file processing, and data archival. The project leveraged Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark, and Scala, alongside Python, Java, and Shell scripting to build robust ETL pipelines. Working extensively with AWS, Databricks, and Dremio, I helped optimize data workflows and enabled efficient query performance for downstream reporting and analytics applications. The solution integrated Oracle and Hadoop-based storage, ensuring seamless CRUD operations and data availability for enterprise users. Additionally, I utilized Trino and Iceberg for efficient data querying and processing, while Kubernetes was deployed to orchestrate scalable workloads. By implementing best practices in Git-based version control and Maven3 build automation, I ensured a streamlined development process. This project provided Apple’s business teams with a high-performance data lake infrastructure, empowering advanced analytics, reporting, and data science initiatives.
