    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Passionate AWS Cloud Engineer with a proven track record of designing, implementing, and optimizing cloud-based solutions to drive operational efficiency and scalability. With a solid foundation in AWS services and a deep understanding of DevOps methodologies, I excel in architecting resilient, highly available, and cost-effective infrastructures for diverse business needs.

My expertise spans across the AWS ecosystem, including but not limited to EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM, CloudFormation, and more. I streamline deployment pipelines and accelerate software delivery while ensuring security and compliance standards are met. Also, I am a Data Engineer with expertise in designing scalable databases and data modeling to drive efficient data storage and analytics. I have a strong background in developing and enforcing data governance principles, ensuring data quality, security (RBAC, IAM), and compliance (GDPR) across both cloud and on-premise environments. Passionate about optimizing data pipelines, real-time processing, and cloud-based solutions, I thrive in building high-performance data architectures that empower businesses with actionable insights.

I thrive in dynamic environments, collaborating cross-functionally to align technical solutions with business objectives. Whether it's implementing infrastructure as code practices, or orchestrating containerized applications with Kubernetes, I am committed to driving innovation and continuous improvement.

I am dedicated to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies and best practices in cloud computing and automation. Let's connect to discuss how I can contribute to your team's success in navigating the complexities of the cloud landscape and achieving strategic goals.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AML Data migration and Hadoop/Datalake Platform</strong> – As a Senior Big Data Engineer at Apple, I led the design and development of a scalable Data Warehousing solution that enabled historical data loading, incremental ingestion, batch file processing, and archival. I engineered robust ETL pipelines using technologies like Hadoop, Hive, Spark, and Scala, complemented by Python, Java, and Shell scripting. Leveraging AWS, Databricks, and Dremio, I optimized data workflows to support efficient query performance for downstream analytics. The solution integrated both Oracle and Hadoop-based storage for seamless CRUD operations and enterprise-wide data accessibility. I employed Trino and Apache Iceberg for performant data querying, while Kubernetes was used to orchestrate scalable data workloads. I also adopted best practices in version control with Git and automated builds with Maven3, resulting in a streamlined, high-performance data lake infrastructure that empowered advanced analytics and data science initiatives across the organization.
</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time Data Ingestion</strong> – Built Kafka and Oracle-based ingestion to S3, applied transformation, and built analytical datasets for downstream.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Data Quality Management</strong> – Developed tools for post-ingestion data validation, anomaly detection, and alerting.</li>
      <li><strong>Databricks Setup at Scale</strong> – Deployed and maintained custom Databricks runtime images in Apple-specific VPCs serving 150+ teams.</li>
    </ul>
